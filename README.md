## Hi there 👋

<!--

# - "Far from a 'null', yet farther still from 'new'.
# - One has but to face the spiral of 'All', a loop as infinite as it is finite, by which the code compiles—a facade as 'sincere' as it is 'debugged'.
# - If one is to 'refactor', one must first 'commit'.
# - Yet the 'merge' must be done with caution, for the 'exceptions' one may not stand to 'catch'."
